# Python Sudoku Solver

This is a simple sudoku solver written in Python. I created this project in May 2014 and is one of the first projects I
completed when I started learning Python. The code is not pretty and the solver cannot handle difficult puzzles, but it
gives me a feeling of nostalgia. I intentionally left the code as it was when I first wrote it to show my progress in
programming. On my GitHub page, you can find more advanced sudoku solvers written in Haskell and Rust.
